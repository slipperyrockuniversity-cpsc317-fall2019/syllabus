# CPSC 317 - O1
This course emphasizes programming using scripting languages for the purpose of collecting and manipulating system information by system administrators and managers. Programming concepts such as data types and control structures will be discussed as well as operating system commands. A variety of languages and utilities will be discussed such as Python, Node, Git, GraphQL, continuous delivery / integration, JavaScript, TypeScript, and React/Angular. The student is expected to have programming experience and knowledge of the Unix and Windows environments.

### Software
**_Also upodated frequently_**
We will be using a lot of either open source or free to use software in the class. A few items to get you started:
- Shell Software
    - Mac: [https://www.iterm2.com/](https://www.iterm2.com/)
    - Windows: [https://cmder.net/](https://cmder.net/)
- JetBrains Software (Get your free student on)
    - [https://www.jetbrains.com/student/](https://www.jetbrains.com/student/)
    - PyCharm first
    - Webstorm if you want it
- Github student account

## Grading
The course grades will be based upon assignments, labs, participation, and tests. The following is a tentative point scale for the course. Final grades will be assessed by dividing points earned by the student by total possible points. 

|Object                                |Percentage|
|--------------------------------------|---------:|
|Exam 1                                |15        |
|Exam 2                                |15        |
|Final Exam / Project                  |30        |
|Assignments                           |25        |
|Tech News Briefs                      |05        |
|In Class Labs                         |10        |
|Participation Bonus                   |05        |

*I am aware that this adds up to 105%. To get credit for partcipiation you have to be here, and participate. I strongly believe in Kolb's experiental learning model, which only works when you participate.*

## Academic Integrity
The University has an official policy on academic integrity can be found at [http://catalog.sru.edu/content.php?catoid=23&navoid=447#acad_inte](http://catalog.sru.edu/content.php?catoid=23&navoid=447#acad_inte). I want to specifically call out the following highlights.
- Students are expected to be honest in all academic work, refraining from all forms of academic dishonesty.
- Students are expected to function as such, including, but not limited to, attending class regularly and completing all assignments and examinations on their own unless the faculty member notes otherwise.
- Students are expected to learn, practice and apply standard techniques for accurately citing resource material.  It is the student’s, not the instructor’s, responsibility to ensure that all material is cited.

## Course Description and Course Goals
|Learning Outcomes| Assessed Course Objectives|
|-----------------|---------------------------|
|PS & CT d. Implement computing solutions that consist of system and application software written in various programming languages|Select among available scripting languages and utilities for the most appropriate language and integrate with markup languages.|
|PS & CT e. Create efficient, user-friendly applications appropriate to the computing problems|☝️|
|C & IS c. Devise effective user interfaces based on the application|Write self-documenting code with an appropriate user interface that meets the style requirements for readability and usability.|

## Title IX
Slippery Rock University and its faculty are committed to assuring a safe and productive educational environment for all students. In order to meet this commitment and to comply with Title IX of the Education Amendments of 1972 and guidance from the Office for Civil Rights, the University requires faculty members to report incidents of sexual violence shared by students to the University's Title IX Coordinator. The only exceptions to the faculty member's reporting obligation are when incidents of sexual violence are communicated by a student during a classroom discussion, in a writing assignment for a class, or as part of a University-approved research project. Faculty members are obligated to report sexual violence or any other abuse of a student who was, or is, a child (a person under 18 years of age) when the abuse allegedly occurred to the person designated in the University protection of minors policy. Information regarding the reporting of sexual violence and the resources that are available to victims of sexual violence is set forth at: [http://www.sru.edu/offices/diversity-and-equal-opportunity/sexual-misconduct-and-victim-resources](http://www.sru.edu/offices/diversity-and-equal-opportunity/sexual-misconduct-and-victim-resources).

## Preferred Pronouns, Names, and Inclusion
The instructor hopes to create a space where students have the opportunity to bring all aspects of their selves into the classroom in order to fully engage in this course. I support people of all gender expressions and gender identities and encourage students to use the name and set of pronouns which best reflect who they are. In this spirit, I welcome and expect all students to also use the correct name and pronouns of their classmates. I will do my best to respect and use the language you use to refer to yourself and will encourage other members of our classroom community to do the same. Please inform me if my documentation reflects a name or set of pronouns different from what you use, and if you have any questions or concerns, please contact me after class, by email, or during office hours.
